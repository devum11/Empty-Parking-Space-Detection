This repository provides a solution for detecting empty parking spaces using the cvzone library and OpenCV's image processing methods. The goal of this project is to create an intelligent parking management system that utilizes computer vision to identify and monitor available parking spaces in real-time.For this project A drone is used to capture a 30 second video of a parkingLot from the top angle.

Key Features:

cvzone Integration:
The repository leverages the capabilities of the cvzone library, which is built on top of OpenCV, to simplify and enhance computer vision applications.

Real-time Image Processing:
Utilizes OpenCV for real-time image processing to analyze live camera feeds or static images of parking lots.

Parking Space Detection:
Employs computer vision algorithms to identify and mark empty parking spaces within the input images or video streams.

Visualization:
Provides visualization tools to display the results, highlighting detected empty parking spaces and potentially occupied ones.

Efficient Algorithms:
Implements optimized algorithms for image segmentation and feature extraction to ensure accurate and fast parking space detection.

Configurability:
Allows users to customize parameters such as sensitivity, region of interest, or camera calibration to adapt the system to different parking lot environments.
